{Software Engineer Intern, IoT Predictive maintenance project:}
{ \href{https://www.maketek.nl/}{MakeTek}/\href{https://www.eaglescience.nl/}{Eaglescience}}
{In a team of 5 students, we developed a failure detection system for elderly assistant tools. I worked on a presentation dashboard using Angular and Django REST framework. Also created anomalies detection on device model with sklearn, that used online learning to stay up to date with new system behavior patterns. Finally, we prepared our system for deployment on RasberryPI based home stations using Docker.}

{Full stack developer Django/ReactJS:}
{ \href{https://everspring.app/nl/home}{Everspring}}
{I worked as a part-time developer at a drop-shipping company that directly connects retailers and growers. During my work, I:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Got experience of working and researching a large system that includes 30+
microservices in a mixed team of remote and in person developers.
    \item Developed from the ground plugin that distributed more than a 1000+ products from our system into hundreds Shopify stores, in a concurrent manner, while also processing customer orders. I implemented back-end using Django, front-end using ReactJS, API integration with GraphQL and custom authentication using JWT.
\end{itemize}}
